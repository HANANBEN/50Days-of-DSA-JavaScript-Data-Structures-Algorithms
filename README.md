# 50Days-of-DSA-JavaScript-Data-Structures-Algorithms
50 Days of DSA â€“ JavaScript Data Structures &amp; Algorithms is a learning-focused repository that documents my daily progress in solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems using JavaScript.

This repo is designed to:

Build a strong foundation in core data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash maps, etc.)

Practice popular algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking, graph traversal, etc.)

Include well-structured solutions with explanations and comments for clarity

Improve problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews

The challenge spans 50 days, with consistent coding practice and incremental progress to master DSA concepts in JavaScript
