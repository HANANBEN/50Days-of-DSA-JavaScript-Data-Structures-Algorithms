 Iteration vs recurtion  : 

   --> thing done recursively can also be done iteratively 
   --> does not use recursive call stack space [better space complexity ]
   --> recursion -> ascending phase (calling phase)
                 -> descending phase (returning phase)

   --> Iteration -> only ascending phase 


 ways to write base condition ?
    when to stop recursively calling itself ans start returning 
   -> last valid input 
   -> first invalid input 



Recurrence relation : 

express the solution of a problem as a function of the solutions to smaller instance of the same problem 

solving recursion question :

if you can draw the recursion tree then you can solve easly any recursion question.




recrusion is very important for ace coding interviews :

parent of: 

---> Backtracking => guided form of recrusion 
---->dynamic programming => top down / memorisation is recursive , we will use this to come up with buttom uo / tabulation 
----> greedy algorithms : when you try to optimise next step (short term not larg term )
---> divide and conquor =>  devide problems to sub problems 




complexity analysis of recursive solutions 

==> how we count time complexity in trees => [#nodes ] * [work done per node]
